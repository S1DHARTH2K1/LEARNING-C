#include<stdio.h> - this is preprocessor directive
stdio stands for standard input output 
.h means header
#include<stdio.h> is used to tell the c compiler to include the contents of stdio in the program(printf(), scanf(), fopen(), fclose())
---------------------------------------------------

int main() - function signature
this is the entry point of C program
int : return value is an integrer(like true or flase 0 or 1)
main during compilation OS will look for main function and starts executing the code inside the curl braces
return 0 is used for to know ending of the code. 0 means successfully complited
----------------------------------------------------

if we  use "float" or "double" datatypes in our code the input and output value may have tiny different like input was 99.95 the output will be like 99.949997
